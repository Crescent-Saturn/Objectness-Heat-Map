# Objectness-Heat-Map

Obtain the objectness heat maps for a given image by Faster-RCNN from torchvision

Inspired by this blog [Digging into Detectron 2](https://medium.com/@hirotoschwert/digging-into-detectron-2-part-4-3d1436f91266), the heat maps from the part 4 are interesting to reproduce. Though that blog used Detectron2, this repo reproduces the same results with **torchvision** only.

Just refer to [`Demo_Objectness.ipynb`](https://github.com/Crescent-Saturn/Objectness-Heat-Map/blob/master/Demo_Objectness.ipynb), or run a Colab version here: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Crescent-Saturn/Objectness-Heat-Map/blob/master/Demo_Objectness.ipynb)
